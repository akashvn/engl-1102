## Mumbo Jumbo
seeks to deconstruct modern civilization's focus on structure and rigidity by hijacking its own myths and secrets against itself. In its place, Reed promotes a new order founded on freedom, expressiveness, and joy, arguing that modern order and structure is a corruption of these ideals. (thesis statement here)

## Historical Allusions
Reed tries to reshape the way we think about the past through his portrayal of history in the God myth. It’s important to keep in mind that history is written by the side of the victor. In Mumbo Jumbo, Reed shares the same Atonist history but from the point of view of the occultists. This parallels how the history we are thought comes from a Western perspective because we suppress the voices of minorities. Reed argues against the monotheistic traditions of Western civilization by sharing a story rich with various Gods and different cultures. He shows how history and religion are all more interconnected than it seems. The tale is meant to confuse the reader because it’s a history that was never shared before. The conflict between Atonists and Occultists in the novel symbolizes the real-life conflict between Western civilization and other cultures. Reed also does an interesting job shaping Moses into the God myth. Moses symbolizes Western traditions since he’s a figurehead of Christianity. Moses’ interactions with the Egyptians are a vehicle for larger themes in the book. For example, Moses introduced the idea of soloist music explaining that “no 1 in the audience would be allowed to play” (Reed 182). This represents Moses introducing Monotheism and western traditions to the Egyptian people. Ultimately it seems that Reed includes many historical allusions in the God Myth. The purpose is to show the way history has been manipulated based on the biases of the storyteller. Through his actions, Reed encourages the reader to reclaim true history.

## Language

When telling the God Myth, Reed doesn’t adjust his language at all from the modern-day segments of the story. Rather than utilizing the more formal, “objective” style of language and style guides we traditionally associate with scholarship of history, Reed continues to tell this story using slang and stylistic freedom. This excerpt is full of expletives, modern phrases, and even references to conspiracy theories from the modern age. For example, compare these tellings of the same development — Set getting jealous and angry at Osiris:

**University of Texas**
> However, Set was always jealous of Osiris, because he did not command the respect of those on earth or those in the netherworld. One day, Set transformed himself into a vicious monster and attacked Osiris, killing him.

**Mumbo Jumbo**
> “1 night Set went downstairs and told everybody to ‘cut out that racket.’ ...Set can’t dance became the cry. Even Hully Gullying children on the street would point out Set as the man who can’t shake it ‘til he breaks it.’”

There’s use of “crass” language, like when Set “called [Nepthys] a bitch.” There’s other modern idioms, like Set observing about Iris “That isn’t a bad piece of tail.” The content of Papa LaBas’ story is rebellious in nature, changing the perspective from the Atonist version of the same story. Reed uses the affordances of the medium of the text to provide this rebellion on another level—within the words themselves. This stylistic freedom and slang is clearly associated with the ancient egpytian and African languages, as highlighted later on when Set tells Moses to “talk trash and feed [Isis]”, and Moses doesn’t understand the dialect. In the same excerpt, Reed highlights that Atonists came up with words like “Schizophrenic”, “catatonic,” and “paranoia” to describe the occultists. Atonists used “clinical” language, which is clear when later Atonists in the story use harsh single words like those rather than the almost run-on style that occultists typically use. Focusing on the stylistically free, flowing language of the occultists when describing the myth, then, provides that second layer of rebellion through the text itself—particularly continuing one of the themes of the book that these texts have power. Another consequence of this is that the much more personal and direct language Reed uses draws us into the story, feeling more directly involved than the extremely detached, objective language that is typically used for this type of story.

## Interconnectedness of Religion

The God Myth is actually a story of many gods and many myths, tied together, illustrating the progression and connectedness or religion. Reed introduces us to “The Work”, the foundation of jes grew and occultism, the power of the Osirian art, as something that came from ancient african religion, learned by Osiris at the university of Nysa. The Work 4espread across Egypt and Greece, and much of the world as Osiris traveled. However, occultism was eventually defeated by atonism, fueled by christianity. Atonism has its own power, like the osirians did. Papa LaBas’ tale shows us that this strength and power actually originates from The Work, but a corrupted version of it. This progression is shown below:

By illustrating the connections between religions like this, Reed is highlighting how each level builds on the one prior. He shows us that this is the fundamental rule, and there are no exceptions. Even Atonism, which is so fundamentally opposed to Jes Grew, has the same origins that were merely corrupted at one point in the chain. This lets Reed continue to hijack the Atonist’s own stories, highlighting the hypocrisies and using these tales against them. Another aspect of this is the commentary on monotheism vs. polytheism. Reed very clearly pushes up traditional african religion, which is fundamentally polytheistic. It’s only when The Work is corrupted that religion seems to move to monotheism — Set with Aton, Moses with Judaism, Christianity. This conflict is clear in how “pagan” is a word atonists created to describe occultists. Atonism is about rigid structure, static lives, and maintaining order — all things made much easier when you have one god instead of a pantheon of constant bickering and fighting which make up many myths in polytheistic religions. But having so many gods doesn’t just create chaos, but allows for greater freedom within religion, as Reed seemingly argues.

## Postmodernism and Multimodality
Reed confuses the reader with his strange formatting to make us rethink our previously held beliefs. For example, Reed often includes wrong grammar and formatting like using number symbols instead of spelling the number out. Reed’s disregard for conventions of writing makes the reader question the purpose of literary structures. Our language is so western centric, and Reed’s formatting serves as a protest against that. Reed quite literally breaks structures of modern languages which parallels how induvial should rise up and break unjust structures in society. Mumbo Jumbo is very much a postmodern text in the way it detaches itself with from world. It pokes fun at the absurd ideas that we hold in society.  The way Reed mocks language, religion, and even civilization is postmodern because it seems he never takes anything seriously. 

The book breaks many traditional literature structures in an effort to disorient the reader. The book opens with the first chapter and the title only appears later, similar to a movie opening scene. The novel is filled with oddly formatted text, diagrams, and images. Reed is very intentional with his actions to break structures because it forces the reader to have an open mind when understanding the unusual aspects of the novel.
